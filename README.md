# HELP!

A friend of yours is getting married, but the site they used to track their wedding plans went out of business.

The failed startup was kind enough to send them a data dump, but it's in a crazy nested hash.

They've asked you to help them decipher the data, and answer some questions.

Some kind developer already started some methods and wrote some code that checks them for you; you just need to fill the methods in. Check the code for hints!


Exercise
======

* cd to project directory
* `$ ruby wedding.rb`
* Read the source code and make the code pass!
